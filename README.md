<strong>Practicing CSS Basics</strong>

<strong> </strong><strong>Step 1. </strong>In that window, duplicate the <strong>index.html </strong>file and rename the duplicate <strong>index2.html</strong>. Next, click down into the css folder and duplicate the <strong>site.css </strong>file and rename the duplicate <strong>site2.css—</strong>we are making copies of these files in order to preserve the original files, in case you wish to revisit the

“finished” and unaltered versions of the originals.

<strong>Step 2. </strong>Open the <strong>index2.html </strong>file in Sublime Text by either using the File menu &gt; Open File command in the program or by dragging the file from the folder window into the blank Sublime Text window.

<strong>Step 3. </strong>Complete the following edits and additions in the <strong>index2.html </strong>file:

<ol>

 <li>Ensure that the externally linked CSS file reference in the &lt;head&gt; portion of code correctly points to the site2.css file</li>

 <li>Create a new &lt;section&gt; portion of code below the existing &lt;section id=”main”&gt; that currently comprises most of the index2.html</li>

 <li>Give this new &lt;section&gt; an id of “<strong>secondary</strong>”</li>

 <li>Within the new main2 &lt;section&gt;, type or paste in this code:</li>

</ol>

 <li>Save your edits to index2.html in Sublime Text and then open the index2.html file in a blank browser window to proof and ensure it looks like the figure at</li>

</ol>




<strong>Step 4. </strong>Next, open the <strong>site2.css </strong>file in Sublime Text by either using the File menu &gt; Open File command in the program or by dragging the file from the folder window into the blank Sublime Text window.




<strong>Step 6. </strong>Please complete the following edits and additions in the <strong>site2.css </strong>file:

<ol start="2">

 <li>Define a new <strong>ID selector </strong>called <strong>secondary</strong>, immediately after the current <strong>main </strong>selector in the site2.css file; you may start with the same styles defined in the current <strong>main </strong></li>

</ol>




<ol>

 <li>Make the sole style of the <strong>secondary</strong></li>

</ol>

selector the color ff0000 (red).

<ol start="2">

 <li>At this point, do a quick proof of your <strong>html </strong>file, which should look like the figure at right.<img decoding="async" data-recalc-dims="1" data-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.ankitcodinghub.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/582.png?w=980&amp;ssl=1" class="alignright lazyload" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==">

  </noscript></li>

</ol>






















3. Back in the site2.css file in Sublime Text, create a new <strong>relative selector</strong>, based on the <strong>secondary </strong>ID selector and pertaining ONLY to the <strong>&lt;h3&gt; </strong>headline—this relative selector should have a color style of #0066ff and a letter-spacing style of 7px. When proofing your index2.html file, your results should now look like the figure at

  </noscript>Step 5</strong>. Finally, back in your site2.html file, create a new class selector called highlight, which has a background color of yellow and a font-weight of bold. Save your work, both in your index2.html and site2.css files. Be sure to proof your finished work a final time in your browser before submitting your assignment. Your finished work should look like the figure at left.
